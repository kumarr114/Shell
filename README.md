Take a SSH Session to VxRail Manager,get root access change permission to 755.

The script attached is going to perform 4 checks and give you the possible causes:-
1.	VxRail Agent is initialized or not on ESXi host
2.	VxRail is able to list firmwares.
3.	The Users created on Idrac is accessible or not.
4.	ISM is pingable thus iDRAC switch is working as expected.
